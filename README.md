Hello there ðŸ‘‹! I work as an integration consultant @ [SAP](https://sap.com) part of the [SAP Ariba](https://www.ariba.com/) team. 

I help customers integrate their existing systems with SAP Ariba, as well as extending the capabilities of the product by consuming the SAP Ariba extensibility options available.

I'm currently learning:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Just following the book -> `$ rustup docs`.
- [Enterprise messaging](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_ENTERPRISE_MESSAGING/Cloud/en-US) and [Kyma](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) runtime available in [SAP Cloud Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html).
